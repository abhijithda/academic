#8a>.	Write a shell script that finds and displays all the
#	links to a file specified as the first argument to the
#	script. The second argument, which is optimal can be 
#	used to specify the directory in which the search is to 
#	begin. If this second argument is not present, the search
#	is to begin from the current directory. In either case,
#	the starting directory as well as all it's sub-directories
#	at all levels must be searched. The script need not 
#	include any error checking.
