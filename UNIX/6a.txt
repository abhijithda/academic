#6a>.	Write a shell script to implement terminal locking
#	(similar to the lock command it should prompt the 
#	user for a password. After accepting the password
#	entered by the user it must prompt again for the 
#	matching password as confirmation and if the the
#	match occurs, it must lock the keyboard until a 
#	matching password is entered again by the user note
#	that the script must be written to disregard break,
#	control-d, etc. No time limit need be implemented 
#	for the lock duration).
