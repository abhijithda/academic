written paper through a group discussion session. The stress here is to test the ability
of the candidate to think logically and present these thoughts in a lucid manner. </font><font

<p>The candidates are given a scenario and conditions applying to it and have to reach a
decision according to the data. They will then be asked to explain their respective
decisions.</p>
