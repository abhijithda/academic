## Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Dynamic Optimization algorithm which is inspired by the social insects - Real Ants behavior of Foraging, Division of Labor, Task Allocation. 
At first their chose their path with equal probability. Ants use Pheromone (Its an aromatic essence, which they deposit while traveling) to sense their paths and reinforce their line.

This Optimization algorithm can be applied for several problems like Finding Shortest Paths, Traveling Sales Man Problem (TSP), Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP), Dynamic Routing and Traffic Control in Networks and also for designing Protocols and Services, Satellite Image Classification (SIC), Remote Sensing, VOIP, Job Scheduling and so on.
